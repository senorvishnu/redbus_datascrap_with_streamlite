# redbus_datascrap_with_streamlite
This RedBus Data Scraper &amp; Analyzer automates bus data extraction using Selenium, stores it in an SQLite database, and analyzes it via Streamlit. It scrapes details like price, rating, and availability, saves them in bus_details.db, and provides insights on cheapest, fastest, and highest-rated buses for easy comparison.
